# 🎬 Kaggle Movie Metadata API Analysis

This project demonstrates how to use the **Kaggle API** to download and analyze real-world movie data. It was completed as part of a data science learning exercise and will serve as a foundation for future final projects.

## 📌 Objective

To practice:
- Downloading a dataset using the Kaggle API
- Loading a `.csv` file into a Pandas DataFrame
- Performing basic data cleaning and filtering
- Calculating the average revenue for Action movies
